## Prose style (`vale`)

### Sentence-case headings

Rule: `little-matches/Headings`

Headings must use sentence-style capitalization. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.

- Wrong: `## Key Design Decisions`
- Right: `## Key design decisions`

The `.vale/little-matches/Headings.yml` file lists exceptions for proper nouns and acronyms.

### Hedging and weasel words

Rules: `write-good/Weasel`, `proselint/Hedging`

Remove hedging phrases and weasel words. State facts directly.

- Wrong: "This is arguably the best approach"
- Right: "This approach reduces latency"

### Passive voice

Rules: `Google/Passive`, `write-good/Passive`

Convert passive constructions to active voice.

- Wrong: `The configuration is processed by the runtime`
- Right: `The runtime processes the configuration`

### Wordy phrases

Rule: `write-good/TooWordy`

Replace wordy phrases with concise alternatives.

- `in order to` becomes `to`
- `due to the fact that` becomes `because`
- `at this point in time` becomes `now`

### AI tell phrases

Rule: `ai-tells`

Remove formulaic phrases common in AI-generated text.

- Delete `it is important to note that` and state the point directly
- Delete `it is worth mentioning that` and state the point directly
- Replace `delve into` with `examine` or a more specific verb
- Delete `at its core` and similar filler

## Vocabulary additions

When adding words to `.vale/config/vocabularies/little-matches/accept.txt`:

- Maintain alphabetical order (case-insensitive sort)
- Use regular expression character classes for case: `[Ff]oo` accepts both "Foo" and "foo"
- Add possessive forms if needed: `Foo('s)?`
- Add plural forms if needed: `[Ff]oos?`
- Check existing entries before adding duplicates
